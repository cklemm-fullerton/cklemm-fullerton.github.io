## Good CPSC 120l Labs

Lab 3 Part 2: This was quite a step up in difficulty but I enjoyed using function calls. I used a function to get all the inputs for beginning and ending year, month, and day. That would have been annoying to do but with functions it was greatly simplified. 

Lab 7 part 1: In this activity we needed to take command line inputs for street and time and respond if a person could park there. This used quite a bit of boolean logic which was quite difficult to wrap my head around. I enjoyed thinking about conditions in the slightly different way that boolean logic requires. 

Lab 9 part 1: This was the first introduction into file systems and it was a doozy. There were many for each loops to get the contents of a file into a vector which took a while to figure out. For how much work I put into this project the main file is surprisingly elegant with just 3 function calls, a std::cout section to print the result, and an if statement to check if there was command line input.
